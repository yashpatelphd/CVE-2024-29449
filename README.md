# CVE ID
CVE-2024-29449

# Title
Cleartext Transmission Vulnerability in ROS2 Humble Hawksbill

# Vulnerability Type
Unencrypted Communications Vulnerability

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS2 Humble Hawksbill (ROS_VERSION=2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
A significant security flaw has been identified in ROS2 Humble Hawksbill, particularly in versions defined by ROS_VERSION=2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3. This vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of data across the ROS2 nodes' communication channels. Without adequate encryption, these transmissions are vulnerable to interception by attackers, leading to a potential compromise of sensitive information through man-in-the-middle attacks.

# Impact
The exploitation of this vulnerability poses a high risk of information disclosure. Attackers could intercept, view, and possibly alter sensitive data being transmitted between ROS2 nodes. This breach could have serious implications for the privacy and integrity of the data managed within the ROS2 framework, especially in applications where confidentiality is critical.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability is exploitable through several methods, including network sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, exploiting unsecured network protocols, and unauthorized network access. These techniques can be used to intercept and compromise data transmitted in cleartext over the network.

# Solution
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is advised that users upgrade to a version of ROS2 that incorporates proper encryption mechanisms for data transmission. Additionally, users should implement network security practices, such as the use of VPNs, secure wireless networks, and encrypted communication protocols, to protect against unauthorized access and data interception.

# Workaround
In the absence of an immediate upgrade, users can reduce their risk by ensuring all communications over ROS2 occur within a secure network environment. Implementing network-level encryption, such as through VPNs or using secure wireless networks, can also help protect data during transmission.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
